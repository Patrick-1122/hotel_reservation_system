Key Features
Book Room: Reserve hotel accommodations.
Check Availability: Verify room status for desired dates.
Calculate Bill: Generate accurate billing for services.
Core Functionalities
The system's core functionalities are structured around essential operations to manage room bookings, availability, and financial transactions.

Room Booking
Create: Enable users to select a room and specific dates to book, capturing all necessary guest information for the reservation.
Availability Checking
Read: Check room availability for specified dates.
Action: Display Availability: Show users all available rooms that match their criteria.
Billing and Payment
Read: Calculate the total bill, taking into account room rates, duration of stay, and any additional charges.
Action: Initiate Payment: Allow users to proceed with payment for their booking.
Action: Record Payment: Securely record all payment details upon successful transaction.
Action: Generate Bill: Produce a detailed breakdown of charges for the user.
System Actors and Use Cases
Understanding who interacts with the system and how is crucial. Below are the identified actors and the primary use cases.

Actors
Guest/User: The primary individual interacting with the system for bookings and inquiries.
Hotel Administrator: Manages system configurations, room inventory, and bookings.
Secondary Actors
These are external entities or systems that interact with our Hotel Reservation System:

Payment Gateway: Processes all payment transactions.
Database System: Stores and retrieves all system data.
Email Service: Handles sending automated emails (e.g., booking confirmations).
Printing Service/Device: Manages the physical printing of receipts.
Use Cases
Here are the key interactions within the system:

Book Room

Primary Actor: Guest/User
Description: The guest searches, selects, and confirms a room reservation.
Flow: Guest searches for rooms → System displays available rooms → Guest selects a room → Guest provides personal details → Guest confirms booking → System creates booking record → System (potentially) sends confirmation email.
Check Room Availability

Primary Actor: Guest/User
Description: The guest inquires about room availability for specific dates.
Flow: Guest specifies dates → System queries for available rooms → System displays availability.
Make Payment

Primary Actor: Guest/User
Secondary Actor: Payment Gateway
Description: The guest completes the financial transaction for their booking.
Flow: Guest initiates payment → System presents payment options → Guest enters payment details → System sends info to Payment Gateway → Payment Gateway processes payment → System updates booking status.
Calculate Bill

Primary Actor: System
Description: The system computes the total cost of a booking.
Flow: System retrieves booking details → System retrieves room rate → System calculates cost based on duration → System adds taxes/fees → System displays final bill.
Print Receipt

Primary Actor: System
Secondary Actor: Printing Service/Device
Description: The system generates and facilitates the printing of a payment receipt.
Flow: System retrieves payment and booking details → System formats receipt → System sends receipt data to printer.
Additional Use Cases (Administrator-Specific)
Manage Rooms
Primary Actor: Hotel Administrator

Prerequisites
You will need a C++ compiler installed on your system. The most common one is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available on Linux, macOS (via Xcode Command Line Tools), and Windows (via MinGW or Cygwin).

Windows: Install MinGW-w64 or Visual Studio with C++ tools.
macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools by running xcode-select --install in your terminal.
Linux: Install build-essential (which includes GCC) using your distribution's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install build-essential for Debian/Ubuntu).

How to Compile
Navigate to the project directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to where you've cloned or saved the project files.

Bash
cd /path/to/your/hotel-reservation-system
Compile the source code: Use your C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the source files. If your main source file is main.cpp, you would typically compile it like this:

Bash
g++ main.cpp -o hotel_reservation_system
g++: The command to invoke the GNU C++ compiler.
main.cpp: Replace this with the name of your main source file. If you have multiple .cpp files, list them all: g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp main.cpp -o hotel_reservation_system.
-o hotel_reservation_system: This specifies the name of the executable output file. You can choose any name you prefer.

How to Run
After successful compilation, you can run the executable from your terminal:

Bash
./hotel_reservation_system
./: This indicates that the executable is located in the current directory. On Windows, you might just type hotel_reservation_system.exe.
